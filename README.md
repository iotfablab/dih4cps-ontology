# DIH4CPS Network Ontology

The Network Ontology was developed in the EC-funded DIH4CPS research project. It enables the modelling of a network of DIHs and technology providers and is based on a number of standardised catalogues.
It is the basis for the EI2Network Portal (https://portal.ei2network.eu/).

The DIH4CPS project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 872548.
